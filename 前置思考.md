评价指标:
| Evaluation Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Perplexity (PPL) | Measures the quality of the model; lower scores are better. |
| BLEU | Evaluates the similarity between the generated and reference sentences; scores range from 0.0 (mismatch) to 1.0 (perfect match). |
| ROUGE | Evaluates automatic summarization and machine translation using precision, recall, and F-measure of n-gram, longest common subsequence, etc. |
| Length Accuracy | Assesses how accurately the model predicts sequence length. |
| Edit Distance | Measures the number of operations needed to transform the model's output to the target sequence; lower scores are better. |
| Attention Alignment Score | Measures the quality of attention alignment; the specific formulation might vary depending on the method proposed. |
