#### 4.1.2 Evaluation Metrics

To assess our model's effectiveness, we use Spearman's correlation as the primary evaluation metric for various tasks, aligning with the industry standards. Spearman's correlation is calculated using SentEval[^5], and results are reported in the "all" setting for consistent baseline comparisons.

### 4.2 Experimental Design

In this section, we outline the experimental setup, including data collection, model configurations, and evaluation metrics.

#### 4.2.1 Data Collection

For our experiments, we utilize the following datasets:

**Extrapolation Task Dataset:**
- Size: 10,000 examples
- Source: Synthetic data generation

**Validation Set:**
- Size: 1,000 examples
- Source: Split from the extrapolation dataset

The "Extrapolation Task Dataset" is synthetically generated to evaluate our model's ability to predict sequences beyond their training sequence length.

#### 4.2.2 Model Configurations

We specify the model configurations for our experiments:

- Tokenization: WordPiece
- Vocabulary size: 30,000
- Maximum sequence length: Variable based on the task and computational resources
- Positional Embedding Function: Sinusoidal, enabling positional embeddings beyond the maximum sequence length

Our backbone model is a BERT variant with the following specifications:

- Number of layers: 12
- Hidden units per layer: 768
- Attention heads: 12
- Attention Method: Dot product attention with a temperature scaling factor

To investigate the impact of Attention Alignment, we introduce a new hyperparameter, 'alpha,' controlling the alignment, which is optimized via validation on a development set.

#### 4.2.3 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the model's performance, we use the following metrics:

**Extrapolation Task:**
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on predicted sequences beyond the training sequence length

**Validation Set:**
- Classification accuracy for classification tasks or task-specific metrics for other tasks

All models are trained with a batch size of 32 using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 3e-5. We include a warm-up period of 10% of total training steps with linear learning rate decay. Training is performed on one or multiple GPUs, depending on hardware availability. Evaluation is conducted on a separate validation set to prevent overfitting and ensure result reliability.
