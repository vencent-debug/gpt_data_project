The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contributions of individual components to the model's performance. As observed in the table, removing Flexible Positional Embeddings leads to an increase in perplexity, lower BLEU and ROUGE scores, reduced Length Accuracy, higher Edit Distance, and a decrease in Attention Alignment Score. Similarly, when Attention Alignment is removed or Token Length Extrapolation is omitted, the corresponding metrics are affected.

It is important to note that the actual performance of these components could vary significantly, and conducting empirical tests is crucial to comprehend their real performance and potential limitations. The ablation study allows us to isolate the impact of each component, aiding in a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's capabilities.
