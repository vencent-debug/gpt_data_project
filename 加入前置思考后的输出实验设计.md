### Evaluation Metrics
To assess the effectiveness of our model, we employed evaluation metrics commonly used in the field of natural language processing. Specifically, we used Spearmanâ€™s correlation as the evaluation metric for the tasks, which aligns with the established standards in the community.

## 4.2 Model Architecture

We employed a BERT variant as our base model for this study. The model consists of 12 layers, each with 768 hidden units and 12 attention heads. Self-attention computation is performed using the dot product attention mechanism with a temperature scaling factor.

## 4.3 Input Preparation
- Tokenization: We utilized the WordPiece tokenizer.
- Vocabulary size: We set the vocabulary size to 30,000.
- Maximum sequence length: The maximum sequence length varies depending on the specific task and available computational capabilities.

## 4.4 Positional Embedding
We used a sinusoidal function to generate positional embeddings. These embeddings are designed to accommodate sequences beyond the maximum sequence length set for the task.

## 4.5 Attention Alignment
To investigate attention alignment, we introduced a new hyperparameter 'alpha' which controls the alignment strength. The optimal value of 'alpha' is determined through validation on a development set.

## 4.6 Output Generation
The output generation method varies based on the specific task under consideration. For classification tasks, we employ softmax activation and cross-entropy loss.

## 4.7 Training
- Batch size: We used a batch size of 32 for training.
- Learning rate: The learning rate was set to 3e-5.
- Optimizer: We used the Adam optimizer.
- Warmup period: The warmup period accounted for 10% of the total training steps.
- Learning rate decay: We applied linear decay of the learning rate.
- Hardware: Training was conducted on one or multiple GPUs.

## 4.8 Evaluation
Evaluation was performed on a separate validation set to ensure model performance was assessed without overfitting.

Please note that these results are for illustrative purposes and do not represent actual empirical data.

## 5.2 Ablation Study

To gain a deeper understanding of the model's performance, we conducted an ablation study on the "Attention Alignment and Flexible Positional Embeddings Improve Transformer Length Extrapolation" paper. The following table (Table 4) presents the results of our ablation study, where we systematically removed different components and observed their impact on various evaluation metrics:

### Table 4: Ablation Study of Attention Alignment and Flexible Positional Embeddings

| Component                               | Perplexity (PPL) | BLEU  | ROUGE | Length Accuracy | Edit Distance | Attention Alignment Score |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----- | ----- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Full Model (AA-FPE-TLE)                 | 19.2             | 0.76  | 0.81  | 0.92            | 13            | 0.89                     |
| - Flexible Positional Embeddings        | 23.1             | 0.68  | 0.72  | 0.83            | 17            | 0.79                     |
| - Attention Alignment                    | 22.4             | 0.67  | 0.70  | 0.81            | 18            | 0.76                     |
| - Token Length Extrapol

ation            | 21.3             | 0.70  | 0.73  | 0.82            | 16            | 0.78                     |

The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contributions of individual components to the model's performance. As observed in the table, removing Flexible Positional Embeddings leads to an increase in perplexity, lower BLEU and ROUGE scores, reduced Length Accuracy, higher Edit Distance, and a decrease in Attention Alignment Score. Similarly, when Attention Alignment is removed or Token Length Extrapolation is omitted, the corresponding metrics are affected.

It is important to note that the actual performance of these components could vary significantly, and conducting empirical tests is crucial to comprehend their real performance and potential limitations. The ablation study allows us to isolate the impact of each component, aiding in a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's capabilities.
